Why use Grunt?
The Grunt ecosystem is huge and it's growing every day. With literally
hundreds of plugins to choose from, you can use Grunt to automate just
about anything with a minimum of effort. If someone hasn't already
built what you need, authoring and publishing your own Grunt plugin to
npm is a breeze.
